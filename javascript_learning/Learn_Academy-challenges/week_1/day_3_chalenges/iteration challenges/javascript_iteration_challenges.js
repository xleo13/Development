// For to While challenge
// Re-write the following as a while loop:
//
// for (var i=0; i<10; i++) { console.log(i); }

/////////////////////////////CHALLENGE COMPLETED///////////////////////////////

//create variable to start at 0
//create while loop with a condition to be less than 10
//console log the variable i
//increment i by 1 at the end of statement
var i = 0;
while(i < 10){
  console.log(i)
  i++
};
// What is the value of i after the loop? Is it the same in both cases?
//answer= it will increment by 1 everytime it run the loop



// .. and Back
// Re-write the following as a for loop:
//
var a = 10;
while (a > 0) {
  console.log(a);
  a = a - 1;
}



//create for loop with starting variable set at 10
//create condition in for loop after creating var in for loop
//de-increment variable inside for loop after the condition
//create statement after for loop to console log variable from for loop
for (var a = 10; a > 0; a--) {
  console.log(a)
};
// Is the value of a the same after the loop?
//answer= no it decreases the number where it started down everytime it runs the loop
