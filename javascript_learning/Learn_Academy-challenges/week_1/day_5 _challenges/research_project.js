Async Javascript Hunt
RESEARCH CHALLENGE
One of the skills you will need over and over in a career with any sort of web development is research. A client or boss will ask you to do something or implement a software or framework that you have never used before, and we need the skills and confidence to know we can go out and learn it ourselves.

Do some research on the topics listed below, and be careful to note the resources you like, authors who make sense to you, video tutorial channels that you trust. Keeping a list of some go-to resources can be a huge help. Also consider signing up for newsletters or email blasts that can keep you up to date on technologies you are interested in.
